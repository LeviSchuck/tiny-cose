A very incomplete COSE library for use with other `tiny-*` libraries.

## What's inside

This implementation provides (incomplete):

- Deserializing public and private key objects into JavaScript `CryptoKey`s
- Serializing JavaScript private and public `CryptoKey`s into public and private
  COSE key objects
- Deserializing and serializing symmetric `CryptoKey`s into COSE key objects

This implementation omits:

- Signing data with private keys
- Verifying data with public keys
- MACing data with symmetric keys
- Verifying MACd data with symmetric keys
- Direct Encryption of data with symmetric keys
- Direct Decryption of data with symmetric keys
- Encrypting data with asymmetric keys with ephemeral-static / static-static key
  agreement
- Decrypting data with asymmetric keys with ephemeral-static / static-static key
  agreement
- Key agreement with key wrapping
- Key transport
- ECDH
- Key Derivation Functions

This implementation does not support:

- RSA keys with multiple primes
- Elliptic Curve keys with compressed points
- `CryptoKey`s for symmetric encryption with AES
- RSAES-OAEP
- Private keys without public components
- ES512 / Curve P-521, see Deno Issue
  [P-521 curves in WebCrypto](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/13449)

Over time, this list may change.

## Warning

COSE cryptography is, in general, unsafe for most to dabble with. Please consult
a cryptographer when you are inventing something new with cryptographic
constructs.
